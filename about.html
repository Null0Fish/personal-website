          Hello, my name is Jackson! I grew up in Arlington, MA, and I am continuing to live in 
          Massachusetts as I attend Northeastern University. I love traveling to learn new things about 
          people and cultures. I have striven to gain a high level of proficiency in Spanish to aid me in 
          such foreign endeavors. Aside from that, I love spending my free time with my friends and 
          compulsively drinking bubble tea.

        <h2>Technical Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently studying Cybersecurity as my major at Northeastern University. I have a large 
          amount of prior experience within the field of Cybersecurity. I have competed in many in-person 
          and online CTFs and also [REDACTED]. Currently I am working towards achieving the certificates of 
          Security+ and Practical Junior Penetration Tester so that I may highlight my skills in a more 
          formal and standardized manner. To complement my preexisting knowledge, I am also completing 
          sections on HackTheBox and TryHackMe in both defensive and offensive security to ensure my 
          knowledge is well-rounded. If you would like to see some of my technical projects, please see my 
          Projects page.
